# morsi
Android application that will relay information from mobile devices to the user through vibration.

Deployed on Google App store: search for "morsi vibration" author oconnerm

In our github repo:

github.com/morrisdc/morsi

Contains source code for our Morsi application. 
Inside app/src/main/java/morsi/morsivibeapp you will find most of the final code.
-MainActivity for main page, Activity2 and 3 for linked pages.

Building this code on your own machine may take some time to aggregate all of the files.
Android Studio auto-generated many files and with our multiple commits this ended up making
the final github a bit messy. But it is all working on the google play store!

Test code is within app/src/ under instrumenttest. We ran it with Android Studio.
-Not as developed as we would have liked but we had a lot of trouble figuring out how to 
test inside Android Studio.

Enjoy! :)
